"HighLow"												
=====================================================================
Author: Derek Chaplin

Description:
For my implementation of a Stack ADT using an array, I made a high/low
card game which uses stacks. The program will allow the user to play
a card game in which the goal is to guess whether the current card's
value will be either higher or lower than the next card's value until
the user reaches the last card in the deck and wins.

Goals:
Users can play a game of high/low.
Users can play as many games as they want.
Program will keep track of the user's highest score each session.
Program will have a graphic user interface.
