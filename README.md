"Maze"												
=====================================================================
Author: Derek Chaplin

Description:
For my implementation of a Stack ADT using an array, I made a maze
game which uses stacks. The program will allow the user to solve the
maze as well as have an option to allow the computer to solve it.
It also will have a graphic interface using JFrames and the user can
control their in-game movements using the WASD or arrow keys.

Goals:
-Users can solve several maze games.
-Users can have the computer solve maze games.
-Program will have a graphic user interface.
-Implements Stack ADT using an array.
-Has the capability to have more mazes added.
